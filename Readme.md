# NexusStack

> A self-hosted, open-source platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that lets you deploy apps to **your own cloud** (AWS, GCP, Azure) or **bare-metal servers** with minimal configuration.

NexusStack empowers developers to **own their infrastructure** while enjoying the Heroku/Vercel/Railway experience. Whether you’re deploying to AWS, a Google Cloud project, or your home lab server, NexusStack abstracts away the complexity and lets you ship faster—with full control.
